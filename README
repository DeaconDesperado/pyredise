A simple and fast search engine based on python and redis

Features:

	- Dynamic insertion, deletion and inspection of documents in corpus, with automatic tf-idf handling
	- Boolean queries interface for tf-idf weighted document retrieval


Dependencies:

	- redis-py (https://github.com/andymccurdy/redis-py)
	
	
Instructions:

	
	- You must have redis installed and configured properly.

	- As a starting point, take a look at corpus_handler.py
	
	- Initialize it with a python-redis instance:
	
	    db=redis.Redis(host='localhost', port=6379, db=0)
    	kwargs = {}
    	kwargs["db"] = redis.Redis(host='localhost', port=6379, db=0)
    	
    	cp = corpus_handler.CorpusHandler(**kwargs)
	
	- Somehow, you must have some documents to feed the INDEX. Assuming that you solved this problem ( use simple files or an SQL server or xml feeds or...), you only need a document's id (doc_id) and its content to index a document

		cp.add_document( doc_id , content.split() )
